It turns out you know your hidden directories too!

Task 3 (of 7): Make a new directory called banana. Inside that directory, create a new file named after whatever fruit you want. Inside that file put the name of a completely different fruit.

After you have completed this, go to the top folder and run the runme.sh file.
